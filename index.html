        <h4>
            This Visualization looks to understand the relationship between what draft pick a player 
            is and their salary. By uisng the radio button you can switch the graph to see the relationship between draft pick 
            rating in NBA 2k20. By looking at the Visualization you can see that their are more high picks
            with high salaries and as the draft pick gets lower, there are less salaries in the top half. 
            One more interesting thing that can be see are the rookie contracts which form a sloping line in 
            the bottom quarter of the graph. The relationship between draft pick and rating is negative, meaning as 
            draft pick increases, the rating will most likely decrease. The main take away is that high draft picks
            typically have a higher rating and higher salary.
            <br>
            I choose the color purple because it contrasts nicely with the white background. I choose points as 
            my marks and controlled them with horizontal and verttical position. This was the best way to represent 
            the 429 players for the 2 variables I was looking into.

        <h4>
            This Visualization shows which NBA teams spend the most on their players. Typically teams with higher 
            payrolls perform better than teams with smaller payrolls. The lakers and heat made the finals in 2020 
            despite only having the 11th and 13th highest payrolls in the NBA, respectively.
            <br>
            I choose this green because it contrasts nicely with the white background and I really like the color. I choose 
            areas as my marks and controlled them with length/area. This allowed my graph to display the difference in 
            salary between each time.

        <h4>
            This Visualization looks to find what countries produce the highest rated nba player on average.
            Most countries do not have any NBA players, only 39 countries do. Countries like Cameroon, 
            Dominican Republic and Switzerland were able to have really high averages because they only had 1 or 2 players who 
            were highly rated. Compared to places like the USA, Spain or Canada where they have a lot of highly rated players 
            and a lot of low rated players making their country average out below 80.
            <br>
            I choose this red because it contrasts nicely with the white background and I really like the color. I choose 
            areas as my marks and controlled them with color. This allowed me to create the chlorpleath map I wanted. This 
            map displayes the countries with higher average ratings as a stronger shade of red and countries with a lower average 
            rating with a lighter shade of red.

            This Visualization looks to find what NBA teams have the most amount of top 10 picks and the most 
            amount of second round picks on their team. It appears the Magic and the Rockets have the most top 10 picks
            on their team and have the most top 10 picks and seocnd round picks on their team.
        
            <br>
            I choose to use red and blue because pop really well of the white background and are complimentary colors.
            The marks in this graph are areas, rectangles and I used the size of these areas to show off the differences 
            in nba draft picks.

            <h4>
                This Visualization looks to find the distribution of salaries in the NBA. About 75% of players make less
                than $15,000,000 per year yet, the most amount people make are around $45,000,000. This makes sense as typically 
                the best players recieve extremely high salaries and team will have 2 or 3 players which combined make over 50% of 
                the total salary cap.
            
                <br>
                I choose to use teal because it pops really well of the white background.

                in nba salary.
